Here's the abstract:

This report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 12492 "Human Activity Recognition in Smart Environments". We established the basis for a scientific community surrounding "activity recognition" by involving researchers from a broad range of related research fields. 30 academic and industry researchers from US, Europe and Asia participated from diverse fields including pervasive computing, over network analysis and computer vision to human computer interaction. The major results of this Seminar are the creation of a activity recognition repository to share information, code, publications and the start of an activity recognition book aimed to serve as a scientific introduction to the field. In the following, we go into more detail about the structure of the seminar, discuss the major outcomes and give an overview about discussions and talks given during the seminar.
