On 16-17 March 2020, we co-organized the [Augmented Humans conference in 
Kaiserslautern.](https://augmented-humans.org/). 
Due to the circumstances related to COVID-19, we moved 
to a fully virtual event and cancelled the physical event on 13th March.
The whole team was struggling and especially thanks to all of the chairs it came together quite well.

On Sunday, just we met (only 2 people, disinfection materials, social distancing and mask wearing in place) 
to pre-record [Stelarc's Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p44RVyD5Qt8)

The keynote was streamed on Monday morning. Stelarc was available
during the streaming to answer questions in the chat and also took several
questions after it over Zoom. I was suprised how well it worked.

The chat worked as a perfect back channel, a lot of researchers engaged
posed questions and provided interesting insights.
