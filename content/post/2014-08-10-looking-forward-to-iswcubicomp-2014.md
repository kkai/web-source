I hope to see you in Seattle. This year we have
again a couple papers outline work from our students.
Attached is a list with draft versions of the papers.
I will write a bit about each topic in the next coming
weeks.

Oh and if you attend please think about stopping
by our [Workshop on Ubiquitous Technologies for Augmenting the Human Mind](http://recall-fet.eu/wahm2014/).
