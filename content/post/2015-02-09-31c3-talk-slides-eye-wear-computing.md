I got tremendous, positive feedback. Thanks a lot! 
Even Heise had a news post about it.

I got mixed some feedback on twitter. Some people
mentioned that I'm working on spy wear helping 
the surveillance state... I believe that 
the research I do is necessary to be out in the
open for the society to discuss the merits
and problems. I want to make sure that we can maximise the benefit for the individual for the tech I develop and minimize abuse from military, companies and governments. Please contact me 
if you want to discuss privacy issues or found concrete problems with my work.
