I'm in the first poster rotation, starting this afternoon:
"Towards inferring language expertise using eye tracking"
Drop by my poster if you're around (or try to spot me, I'm wearing the white "Kai@CHI" Shirt today :)).


Here's the abstract of our work, as well as the [link to the paper](http://kaikunze.de/papers/kunze2013towards.pdf).

"We present initial work towards recognizing reading activities. This paper describes our efforts detect the English skill level of a user and infer which words are difficult for them to understand. We present an initial study of 5 students and show our findings regarding the skill level assessment. We explain a method to spot difficult words. Eye tracking is a promising technology to examine and assess a userâ€™s skill level."
