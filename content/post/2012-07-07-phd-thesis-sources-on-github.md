Finally finished my phD. last year at Passau University.
phD. Advisor Prof. Dr. Paul Lukowicz, second advisor Prof. Dr. Hans Gellersen. 
The thesis is already published at [Opus Bayern](http://www.opus-bayern.de/uni-passau/volltexte/2012/2611/).
The pdf is open access, so feel free to read it (careful it's a 19 MB pdf):
[Compensating for On-Body Placement Effects in Activity Recognition as pdf](http://www.opus-bayern.de/uni-passau/volltexte/2012/2611/pdf/kunze_kai.pdf)

However, the sources were not available.
Finally, I got around to push the [latex sources
of my dissertation](http://github.com/kkai/phdthesis) up to github.

***
Please feel free to use it as a thesis template,
attribution would be apprecitated ;)

***
Please share if you make improvements, there 
are a lot of quick hacks in the sources regarding templating. 
Overall, I'm happy how the final document looks, yet there are small things to be improved.

***
I'll try to share most of the algorithms discussed in my dissertation.

Here's a quick summary about the content together with the slides of my defense:


>This thesis investigates, how placement variations of electronic 
>devices influence the possibility of using sensors integrated in 
>those devices for context recognition. The vast majority of context 
>recognition research assumes well defined, fixed sen- sor locations. 
>Although this might be acceptable for some application domains 
>(e.g. in an industrial setting), users, in general, will have a 
>hard time coping with these limitations. If one needs to remember 
>to carry dedicated sensors and to adjust their orientation from 
>time to time, the activity recognition system is more distracting 
>than helpful. How can we deal with device location and orientation 
>changes to make context 
>sensing mainstream? This thesis presents a systematic 
>evaluation of device placement effects in context recognition.
