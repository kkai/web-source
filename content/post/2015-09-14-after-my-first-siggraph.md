Although we had 2 emerging technology demonstrations (so I had little time to checkout talks), I could at least checkout the other e-tech demos and installations.

The virtual village (virtual reality demos) was the most impressive to me. Before SIGGRAPH, I still felt Oculus and company are just nice gimmicks. Yet, the demos convinced me, from skateboarding to killing virtual orcs it was impressive. Seeing how technology progresses that's what my teenage self wanted at home.

Yet, the SIGGRAPH Electronic Theater was by far the most entertaining event.

Here are the two e-tech submission videos:
