I'm sorry it took so long to put online.
Too much to do, especially due to Augmented Human 2014 (really looking forward to the beginning of march) :)

As part of our monthly [Hacker News meetup](http://hnkansai.org)in Kansai,
I gave a small introduction on how to use (and hack for) Google Glass.

The slides are also available as [pdf download](../../slides/kansai_15.pdf) (7 MB).

The "Hacks" are fairly simple. I more or less show how to develop for Glass using the Native Development Kit and some demonstrations how to read out sensors or other demo code I scraped from github and adjusted (see the slides for links to the sources). The examples include CameraZoom, Face Detection and Blink Recognition.
