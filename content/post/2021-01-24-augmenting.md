Very happy to be invited as one of the panelists presenting in a three-day online symposium on Liveness organised by the [Neurolive EU Project](https://neurolive.info/About). The [symposium](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/liveness-symposium-tickets-141701857069) brings together artists, humanities scholars and cognitive neuroscientists to explore how liveness is conceptualised, measured and practiced across the arts and the sciences.

I'm speaking on the 24th, here's the abstract of my talk and my [slides (carefull ~17 Mb pdf)](http://kaikunze.de/files/liveness2021-kai.pdf)

Abstract:
In my research, I combine design and technology to augment human senses, looking for novel interaction paradigms.
Engineering and computing have often been used to mimic or surpass some human abilities (for example autonomous driving, playing Go). Such efforts appear to put humans and computers in a competitive relationship, as emphasized in AI vs. Human game competitions. Once fantastic fear of AIs “replacing” human workers is now taken much more seriously and discussed in the public sphere. My research proposes a different approach to the human-computer relationship by applying a cooperative and empowering framework, using wearable computing to actively augment human capabilities.

Compared to a computer, our mind has ebb and flow and is affected by various factors, some of which we do not even realize.
At the beginning of my talk, I will discuss how unobtrusive smart glasses and similar technologies can be used
to quantify these factors (e.g. fatigue, stress, alertness) in real-life scenarios. In the second part, I will discuss unobtrusive interaction and actuation technologies to augment humans. We discuss application scenarios of capturing inter-personal synchrony between audience and performers as well as potential body schema extension technologies.
