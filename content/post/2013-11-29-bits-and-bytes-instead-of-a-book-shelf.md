<p class="lead"> An interview made me wonder about how reading habits are changing and how we will narrate stories in the future. </p>


Recently, I gave an interview for the German online issue
of the Scientific American ([Spectrum der Wissenschaft](http://spectrum.de/)) for a [special about reading habits (in German, paywall)](http://www.spektrum.de/alias/lesen/bits-und-bytes-statt-buchregal/1211519).

As I'm interested in the topic, I often hear
that "endless scrolling" is bad as it destroys 
the mental map we make of books and pages or
that reading from backlit screens is eye-straining 
inducing headaches. Personally, I cannot really
understand these complaints. I'm doing most
of my reading on tablet devices or computer screens
though I never experienced these problems directly.

However, active reading -the process of working with the text through highlight, notes, marks- is still better
on paper. In Human Computer interaction terms, people talk about [affordances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance). The affordance of paper is very high for active reading. So I find myself still printing out drafts
or review papers, especially if it's a close call and
I need to concentrate on the contents. In later case, I even like to change the reading environment, moving away
from my laptop/desktop to a meeting table or a bank outside. I believe this helps me concentrate, deliberately shutting out any distractions.

We just started to modify the reading experience using electronic devices.
So far most of the applications and reading devices
directly mimic the book. We have "ebooks", "e-reading" software
use pages and page turns etc. I believe there is a lot of room for improvement related to reading on screens.

Given the possibility to assess the user's mental state using 
[Cognitive Activity Recognition](/papers/kunze2013activity.pdf), we 
can change content, structure and style of reading materials dynamically.
Most straight forward, if an application detects that a reader looses
interest, it could prompt her with an interactive challenge/video or 
similar. Changing fonts, colors and lettering according to mood and 
context could be also interesting. There is a fairly new
playground opening up for anybody curious and interested in 
defining new forms of reading.
