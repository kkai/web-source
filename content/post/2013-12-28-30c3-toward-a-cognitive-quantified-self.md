Here are my [talk slides](/slides/30c3.pdf) for my 30c3 talk ... Sorry it took so long.
Thanks for the great feedback, will write a bit 
more if I have sometime ;)

The video is also online. This happened very quick 
after the event. I'm impressed by the 30c3 content team.

Thanks a lot for the great reviews and suggestions.
They are highly appreciated. You can still [review
the talk](https://frab.cccv.de/en/30C3/public/events/5387/feedback/new).

##Talk Abstract##

The talk gives an overview about our work of quantifying knowledge acquisition tasks in real-life environments, focusing on reading. We combine several pervasive sensing approaches (computer vision, motion-based activity recognition etc.) to tackle the problem of recognizing and classifying knowledge acquisition tasks with a special focus on reading.
