This year I'm really looking forward to [Ubicomp](http://ubicomp.org) and [ISWC](http://iswc.net),
it's the first time that Ubicomp and Pervasive merged into one conference and it's the first time the venue sold out with 700 participants. 

I cannot wait to chat with old friends and experts (most are both :)).

The field slowly matures. Especially, the wearable research is really pushing towards prime-time. Most prominently, Google Glass is getting a lot of focus also discussing its impacts on privacy. Yet, there is more and more talk about fitness bracelets/trackers and smart watches. I expect that we see more intelligent clothes and activity recognition work in commercial products in the coming years. 

By the way, we have 3 poster papers and 2 demos at Ubicomp
and a short paper at ISWC.

###Ubicomp Demos and Posters###

* [My Reading Life – Towards Utilizing Eyetracking on Unmodified Tablets and Phones](/papers/kunze2013my.pdf)
* [Annotate Me – Supporting Active Reading using Real-Time Document Image Retrieval On Mobile Devices](/papers/kunze2013annotate.pdf)
* [Activity Recognition and Nutrition Monitoring in Every Day Situations with a Textile Capacitive Neckband](/papers/cheng2013activity.pdf)

###ISWC paper###
* [I know what you are reading – Recognition of Document Types Using Mobile Eye Tracking](/papers/kunze2013know.pdf)


Drop by at the demo,poster sessions and/or see me my talk on Thursday. 

On a side note, Ubicomp really picks great locations. This year it's Zurich, next year Seattle and the year after it will be in Osaka. Seems I might be staying longer in Japan, than I originally planned ;)
